# Good practice

PragmaticAll values good practices over a prescriptive approach.

Business change always involve humans in complex systems. Humans are not like other 'systems'; their intelligence, intent and identity make 'human systems' very different. In my experience many prescriptive approaches over-constrain such a complex system, making it less effective. The challenge in business change is how to put in enough constraints to make the complexity manageable, without over-constraining the system.

I believe there is no single correct way to do this. I also think that in most cases the best that anyone can do is to plan one or two steps ahead. You may have a rough idea of the way ahead, but it pays to keep observing what happens -- and to adjust your plan based on those observations. That is what I call a pragmatic approach.

To pull this off is harder than it seems. We all have blind spots in our observations. That is where the good practices come in. Equipped with a variety of good practices to suit many different situations, I 'pick and mix' those practices that seem to fit the current situation. By always applying multiple complimentary practices, I compensate for my blind spots.

In this way my plan co-evolves with the information I obtain from observations, improving my (and your) chances of success.
