About PragmaticAll

PragmaticAll: for a down-to-earth approach to business change.

In my work I am guided by the following considerations:

* I value doing **a few things right** over just doing **many things**
* I value **long term relationships** over short term **profit**
* I value**real world** observations over **theoretical **models
* I value **good practices** over **prescriptive method**s

I value the **drive** of motivated people, unleashed through autonomy, freedom to work towards mastery, and being able to contribute to an inspiring purpose.

I believe in enabling people to achieve their own dreams, which is why I support Oxfam Novib's microfinance projects in Africa and Asia.
